# 🎮 Mentorship Session at Vishwakarma University – Game Development PPT session and Demo for Fresher Btech Students

I had the wonderful opportunity to mentor a batch of enthusiastic **first-year computer science students** at **Vishwakarma University**. Under the kind support of the **Dean** and **Head of Department**, I conducted a short lecture and demo session on game development — something I am truly passionate about.

The session was centered around a game I built specifically for this purpose, and I also prepared a presentation to walk the students through the concepts, design, and tools used to make it. Their excitement and positive feedback meant the world to me!

## 🎯 What Was This About?

The goal was simple:  
To show how **anyone can get started with game development**, even with little to no experience — using creativity, logic, and beginner-friendly tools.

I demonstrated how to make games, how to play it, and shared some insights about:
- Game ideas and storytelling  
- Visual development using tools like Buildbox  
- Basic mechanics and level logic  
- How to bring a game to life without writing tons of code

## 🌟 Student Feedback

The response was truly heartwarming.  
Some of the comments from the students included:

> *"That was so cool, I want to try making one myself!"*  
> *"It didn’t look complicated, and the story was really interesting."*  
> *"Thank you for showing us something so different and fun!"*

It felt amazing to know I may have sparked interest in game development among them.

If you would like to check out the game yourself:

1. If it's a Buildbox project:
    - Install **Buildbox 3D** from [buildbox.com]
    - Open the `.bbdoc` file inside the repository
    - Just double-click the file to launch the game

## 🙏 Special Thanks

- Huge thanks to the **Dean** and **HOD** of Rishiken University for the opportunity  
- To the **students**, for being such an engaged and fun audience  
- And to the **Buildbox team**, for creating a tool that makes learning game development so approachable

## 💬 Final Thoughts

This was my **first time mentoring**, and it was such a fulfilling experience.  
Seeing young students inspired and eager to try something new reminded me why I love building and sharing creative work. Here's to many more sessions like this!

If you're reading this and thinking about giving game development a try go for it. You don't need to know everything. Just start with one idea, one tool, and some curiosity. 🚀
